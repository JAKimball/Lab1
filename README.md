# Lab1 - The Growth Mindset (Learning Markdown)

My brother is a professional juggler and has performed around the world with a troop (The Flying Karamazov Brothers) since 2000.  Years earlier I recall a debate he and I had about innate skills and who could and could not learn to juggle.  While I insisted that I believed I would probably have more difficulty than most he insisted that anybody physically able could learn it with the right mindset and practice.
